## Contributing

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to  shared vocabularies.

## Contributing to the discussion

The most important thing you can contribute is your voice. You can do this by [opening and filing issues][1] or participating in discussions regarding other issues.

## Contributing to the documentation

Typos happen. You can help fix them — or contribute more meaningfully to the documentation. One of the great parts about contributing to the documentation is that you don't need to [sign a CLA][2].

## Contributing to the vocabularies

Another great way to contribute is by suggesting new terms or vocabularies for inclusion. Since these are shared vocabularies, we expect you to drive a discussion first by [creating an issue][1] in the issue tracker.

This is a community, so please be respectful when discussing in the issue tracker. If you can't get consensus, that doesn't mean your idea doesn't have merit — it just may not be a great idea for a shared vocabulary.

<small>Fine print: To add a term or vocabulary, you might need to [sign a CLA][2].</small>

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker][3] is the preferred channel for discussion and [submitting pull requests][4], but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for support requests.
* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests — whether to add a vocabulary, add a term, or simply fix a doc — are very much appreciated. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please start a discussion in the issue tracker** before sending significant pull request (e.g. adding a vocabulary), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the community might not agree upon.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. Start by creating an issue.
2. If your hope is to add a vocabulary or term, get closure on the need first. Discussion needs to happen; one voice is not enough.
3. Fork and clone the repository.
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
5. Make your change.
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][5].
7. Reference the pull request from the issue. Get consensus that your addition is the right addition.
8. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style guide. <small>Coming soon</small>
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message][6].

## Legal

If you are contributing a new vocabulary or term, you may need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. You may visit https://cla.microsoft.com to sign digitally. Alternatively, download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx][7] or [Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf][8], sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>. Be sure to include your github user name along with the agreement. Once we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the request.
